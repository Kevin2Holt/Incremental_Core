This is a pet project of mine.

I've been really into idle/incremental games, but there weren't any that really satisfied all of my wishes for an idle/incremental game. So, over time, I designed this concept and finally (at some point) decided to actually put it into being.

Version 1 was more of a general attempt. I worked on the design and look at the same time as I built the functionality. Version 2, I attempted to focus wholely on the functionality (e.g. if there's a button that I can click and it does what it's supposed to do, it doesn't matter what it looks like)

As you might notice, there are a lot of missing parts. While not completely intentional, it is the unfortunate by-product of having many, many random ideas, ADHD which will switch it's hyperfocus every week or two, and life deciding how much time I actually have to work on these many assorted ideas.

In short, yes, I would love to return back to this project. Life just has this way of constantly changing things up on me, and when you combine that with consistently changing priorities, most of my pet/side projects have been put on hold for some unknown amount of time.
